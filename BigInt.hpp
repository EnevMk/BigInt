    /// @brief Paramater Constructor, initializing a BigInt number by String.
    ///
    /// This is the easiest and most intuitive way of initializing an object of Class BigInt.
    /// Given that the library uses a not-so-popular billion number system,
    /// the developers want to use it should conform to some standarts. Since a single digit in a billion number system 
    /// is in the range [0 - 999999999], BigInt numbers can look messy at first. So, the developers have decided that BigInt numbers 
    /// should be represented with a space between every *billion system digit* and no spaces between single (decimal) digits.
    /// Therefore, strings passed to that constructor should stick to that standart.
    /// ### Example
    
    /// BigInt("134 240000"); // This Creates the BigInt number 134 240000, two digits, which in decimal is 134 000 240 000. \n
    /// BigInt("5 1"); // This creates the BigInt number 5 1, that's two digits, which in decimal is 5 000 000 001 \n \n
    
    /// The constructor supports a bit of validation, like removing whiteSpaces.
    /// ### Example
    /// BigInt bigNumber("13     0   99391"); // Creates number 13 0 99391, three digits, 
    /// 13 000 000 000 000 099 391 - thirteen quintillion something.. \n
    /// BigInt("900000000 0") // 900 000 000 000 000 000 - nine hundred quadrillion. \n \n
    /// Passing an invalid string though (cont. symbols other than numbers) causes the program to stop. \n
    /// Therefore developers who use this library in their project should think of implementing proper validation.

    /// for the result before the actual evaluation of the expression. So, for two two-digit numbers and operation + called, memory for 
    /// a Three-digit bignum will be reserved. (BigInt("9 9") + BigInt("9 9") results in BigInt("1 0 8")). 
    /// But, sometimes that may not be a proper final return value - let's have BigInt("2 5") + BigInt("1 5"). In that case we want the answer 
    /// BigInt("4 0"), but as the operator will have reserved a Vector of size three for the result so we will actually have BigInt("0 4 0"),
    /// which is incorrect. That's what this method does - in case of a zero digit on first position, it handles it and returns a correct result.
